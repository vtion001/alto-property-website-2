# GitHub Large File Error Fix Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive solution implemented to fix the recurring GitHub large file error caused by `.local` directory files exceeding GitHub's 100MB file size limit.

## Problem Description

The repository was experiencing push failures due to large files in the `.local/share/pnpm/store` directory:
- File 1: 137.32 MB (exceeds 100MB limit)
- File 2: 137.20 MB (exceeds 100MB limit)

These files were being tracked by Git, causing the push to fail with the error:
```
remote: error: File .local/share/pnpm/store/v10/files/... is 137.32 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB
```

## Root Cause

The `.local` directory contains pnpm store files that are:
- Automatically generated by pnpm
- Can grow very large (hundreds of MB)
- Should never be committed to version control
- Were accidentally tracked by Git due to missing `.gitignore` rules

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated .gitignore
Added comprehensive ignore patterns to prevent future issues:

```gitignore
# Local directories and stores
.local/
.local
.pnpm-store/
.pnpm-store
.pnpm-debug.log*

# Dependencies
node_modules/

# Build outputs
.next/
out/
dist/
build/

# Environment variables
.env*
```

### 2. Removed .local Directory from Git History
Used `git filter-repo` to completely remove the `.local` directory from the entire Git history:

```bash
# Install git-filter-repo
pip install git-filter-repo

# Remove .local directory from entire history
git filter-repo --path .local/ --invert-paths --force

# Re-add remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/vtion001/alto-property-website-2.git

# Force push cleaned history
git push origin main --force
```

### 3. Created Pre-commit Hook
Implemented a pre-commit hook to prevent future large file commits:

```bash
# Location: .git/hooks/pre-commit
# Features:
# - Checks file sizes before commit (max 100MB)
# - Prevents .local directory commits
# - Prevents node_modules commits
# - Provides clear error messages
```

## Results

- ✅ Large files completely removed from Git history
- ✅ Repository size reduced from 158.82 MiB to 1.71 MiB
- ✅ Push to GitHub successful
- ✅ Future large file commits prevented
- ✅ Comprehensive .gitignore in place

## Prevention Measures

### 1. .gitignore Rules
The updated `.gitignore` file now includes:
- `.local/` - pnpm local store
- `.pnpm-store/` - pnpm global store
- `node_modules/` - npm dependencies
- Build outputs and environment files

### 2. Pre-commit Hook
The pre-commit hook automatically:
- Checks file sizes before commit
- Blocks commits containing `.local` directory
- Blocks commits containing `node_modules`
- Provides clear error messages

### 3. Best Practices
- Never commit dependency directories
- Use `.gitignore` for all generated files
- Regular repository size monitoring
- Use Git LFS for legitimate large files

## How to Use

### For Developers
1. The pre-commit hook runs automatically
2. If you try to commit large files, you'll get a clear error
3. Check `.gitignore` before adding new files
4. Use `git status` to verify what's being committed

### For Repository Maintenance
1. Monitor repository size regularly
2. Check for new large files in commits
3. Update `.gitignore` as needed
4. Use `git filter-repo` if large files slip through

## Troubleshooting

### If Large Files Still Appear
1. Check if they're in `.gitignore`
2. Remove from tracking: `git rm --cached <file>`
3. Commit the removal
4. Use `git filter-repo` if in history

### If Pre-commit Hook Fails
1. Check file permissions: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`
2. Verify hook content
3. Check for syntax errors in bash script

### If Push Still Fails
1. Verify large files are removed from history
2. Check remote repository size
3. Use `git filter-repo` if necessary

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Check repository size
git count-objects -vH

# Find large files in history
git rev-list --objects --all | git cat-file --batch-check='%(objecttype) %(objectname) %(objectsize) %(path)' | sort -nrk3

# Remove directory from tracking
git rm -r --cached .local/

# Clean up Git objects
git gc --prune=now

# Force push (use with caution)
git push origin main --force
```

## Future Considerations

1. **Git LFS**: Consider using Git Large File Storage for legitimate large files
2. **Automated Monitoring**: Set up GitHub Actions to check repository size
3. **Documentation**: Keep this document updated with any new patterns
4. **Team Training**: Ensure all team members understand the rules

## Conclusion

The GitHub large file error has been permanently resolved through:
- Complete removal of large files from Git history
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` configuration
- Pre-commit hook protection
- Clear documentation and best practices

This solution ensures the repository remains clean and prevents future issues while maintaining all legitimate code and assets.
